We recommend using **Static Generation** (with and without data) whenever possible because your page can be built once and served by CDN, which makes it much faster than having a server render the page on every request.

## Get started with a new component file

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main(void) {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false), cin.tie(NULL);
  cout << "Hello World!" << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

## ssg-ssr

```js
import React, { useEffect } from 'react';

const COMMENTS_ID = 'comments-container';

const Comments = () => {
    useEffect(() => {
        const script = document.createElement('script');
        script.src = 'https://utteranc.es/client.js';
        script.setAttribute('repo', 'emgoto/emgoto-comments');
        script.setAttribute('issue-term', 'pathname');
        script.setAttribute('theme', 'dark-blue');
        script.setAttribute('crossorigin', 'anonymous');
        script.async = true;

        const comments = document.getElementById(COMMENTS_ID);
        if (comments) comments.appendChild(script);

        // This function will get called when the component unmounts
        // To make sure we don't end up with multiple instances of the comments component
        return () => {
            const comments = document.getElementById(COMMENTS_ID);
            if (comments) comments.innerHTML = '';
        };
    }, []);

    return (
        <div id={COMMENTS_ID} />
    );
};

export default Comments;

We recommend using **Static Generation** (with and without data) whenever possible because your page can be built once and served by CDN, which makes it much faster than having a server render the page on every request.

You can use Static Generation for many types of pages, including:

- Marketing pages
- Blog posts
- E-commerce product listings
- Help and documentation

You should ask yourself: "Can I pre-render this page **ahead** of a user's request?" If the answer is yes, then you should choose Static Generation.

On the other hand, Static Generation is **not** a good idea if you cannot pre-render a page ahead of a user's request. Maybe your page shows frequently updated data, and the page content changes on every request.

In that case, you can use **Server-Side Rendering**. It will be slower, but the pre-rendered page will always be up-to-date. Or you can skip pre-rendering and use client-side JavaScript to populate data.
